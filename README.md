# Shape Red - DOM Game

A shape versus DOM game meant to look similar in style to the first game in a popular franchise, but much simplified to meet project requirements.

Battle as, and against, one of three types of shapes, with each having a unique strength and weakness.

Currently missing most functionality like selecting a name, shape type, and multiple rounds of battle.
